(CVE-2021-2329)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Java VM component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to manipulate Java VM accessible data. (CVE-2019-2909)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS (jackson-databind) component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of serivce of Core RDBMS. (CVE-2019-2956)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read a subset of Core RDBMS accessible data. (CVE-2019-2913)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Spatial component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service of Spatial. (CVE-2016-9572)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take over Core RDBMS (CVE-2018-11058)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Application Express component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to manipulate Application Express accessible data. (CVE-2019-2484)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, local attacker complete access to all Core RDBMS accessible data. (CVE-2019-2569)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Java VM component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to manipulate Java VM accessible data or cause a complete denial of service of Java VM. (CVE-2019-2749)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Text component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read a subset of Oracle Text accessible data or cause a partial denial of service of Oracle Text. (CVE-2019-2753)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker complete access to all Core RDBMS accessible data. (CVE-2019-2776)

- An unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle ODBC Driver component of Oracle Database Server, which could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take over Oracle ODBC Driver. Note this vulnerability only affects the Windows platform. (CVE-2019-2799)

Remmediation

 It is strongly recommanded to update to the latest version and path available.

2). EC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION Is Set to TRACE - HIGH

Description
The SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION setting determines the Oracle's server's logging response level to bad/malformed packets received from the client by generating ALERT, LOG, or TRACE levels of detail in the log files. This setting should have a value of LOG unless the organization has a compelling reason to use a different value because LOG should cause the necessary information to be logged. Setting the value as TRACE can generate an enormous amount of log output and should be reserved for debugging only.

Rationale:
Bad packets received from the client can potentially indicate packet-based attacks on the system, which could result in a denial-of-service condition.
Solution

To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement.
ALTER SYSTEM SET SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION=LOG SCOPE = SPFILE;

Evidence: 
 - run the following query: SELECT UPPER(VALUE) FROM V$PARAMETER WHERE UPPER(NAME)='SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION';

3). GLOBAL_NAMES Is Set to FALSE - HIGH

Description
The global_names setting requires that the name of a database link matches that of the remote database it will connect to. This setting should have a value of TRUE.

Rationale:
Not requiring database connections to match the domain that is being called remotely could allow unauthorized domain sources to potentially connect via brute-force tactics.
Solution

To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement.
ALTER SYSTEM SET GLOBAL_NAMES = TRUE SCOPE = SPFILE;

Evidence:
 - running the following query: SELECT UPPER(VALUE) FROM V$PARAMETER WHERE UPPER(NAME)='GLOBAL_NAMES';

Reference:
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/4252

4). REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE Is Set to EXCLUSIVE - HIGH

Description
The remote_login_passwordfile setting specifies whether or not Oracle checks for a password file during login and how many databases can use the password file. The setting should have a value of NONE or in the event you are running DR/Data Guard, EXCLUSIVE is an allowable value.

Rationale:
The use of this sort of password login file could permit unsecured, privileged connections to the database.

Solution:
To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement.

ALTER SYSTEM SET REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE = 'NONE' SCOPE = SPFILE;

Evidence:
 - running the following query: SELECT UPPER(VALUE) FROM V$PARAMETER WHERE UPPER(NAME)='REMOTE_LOGIN_PASSWORDFILE';
